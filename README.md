# UfmgLeaks
Flask web application to help students of UFMG to share school related materials.

## How to run
Flask is simple! Just clone this repository, enter it and then run:

```console
$ pip intall requirements.txt
$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
$ export FLASK_DEBUG=1  # OPTIONAL (this makes the server reset after any changes)
$ flask run
```
